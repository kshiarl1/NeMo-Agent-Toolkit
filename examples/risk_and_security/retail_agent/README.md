## Key Features

- **Email Processing:** Processes customer emails to understand intent (product inquiry, review submission, or order placement).
- **Customer Management:** Retrieves customer information including purchase history, total orders, and past reviews.
- **Product Catalog:** Access to a comprehensive gardening equipment catalog with descriptions, pricing, stock levels, and reviews.
- **Order Processing:** Handles order placement with stock validation.
- **Review System:** Accepts and processes product reviews from existing customers.
- **ReAct Agent:** Uses iterative reasoning to determine appropriate actions based on email content.

---

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/risk_and_security/retail_agent
```

### Set Up API Keys

If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run the Workflow

Return to your original terminal, and run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/risk_and_security/retail_agent/configs/config.yml --input "Email From: john.doe@email.com
Content: I'm interested in learning about your garden trowels. What options do you have available?"
```

The expected output of this run is shown below in the Examples section.

---

## Agent Capabilities

The retail agent can handle three main types of customer requests:

1. **Product Inquiries:** Customers can ask about specific products or request information about the entire catalog.
2. **Order Placement:** Customers can place orders for products with automatic stock validation and price calculation.
3. **Review Submission:** Existing customers can submit reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.

## Evaluation

The retail agent includes an evaluation framework to assess the agent's performance across various customer service scenarios.

### Running the Evaluation

To run the evaluation, execute the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repository:

```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/risk_and_security/retail_agent/configs/config-eval.yml
```

The evaluation uses the `tunable_rag_evaluator` to score the agent's responses against expected outcomes. The evaluator uses an LLM-as-a-judge approach to determine how well the agent handles each test case.

### Evaluation Dataset

The evaluation dataset (`data/evalset.json`) contains six test scenarios covering:

1. **Product Inquiry:** Customer asking about available garden trowels
2. **Review Submission:** Customer submitting a product review with rating
3. **Order Placement:** Customer placing an order with quantity and total cost request
4. **Unknown Customer Inquiry:** Handling inquiries from customers not in the system
5. **Implicit Product Reference:** Processing a review where the product is not explicitly named (requires the agent to look up purchase history)
6. **Combined Request:** Handling a review submission and order placement in a single email

Each test case includes:

- `question`: The customer email input
- `answer`: A description of the expected agent behavior and response

### Evaluation Output

The evaluation results are saved to `./.tmp/nat/examples/risk_and_security/retail_agent/nat_retail_agent/llama-33-70b/` and include:

- **Scores:** Each response is scored on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Profiler Metrics:** Base performance metrics for workflow execution

The scoring criteria evaluate whether:

- The agent sends an email to the correct recipient
- The agent uses appropriate greetings (Sir/Madam based on context)
- The response contains required information (product details, order confirmation, and so on)
- No inappropriate actions are taken (such as creating orders when only an inquiry was made)

---

## Notes

- **Mock Operations:** The `write_review`, `send_email`, and `update_customer_info` functions are mock operations for demonstration purposes. They do not persist data to the JSON files.
- **Demo Purpose:** This example is designed for demonstration and testing. In a production environment, you would integrate with actual databases and email services.
- **Future Enhancements:** This example serves as a foundation for adding red teaming and defense capabilities to test agent robustness and security.

---

## Architecture

This example uses:

- **ReAct Agent:** Provides iterative reasoning between tool calls to handle complex multi-step customer requests
- **Function Groups:** Organizes related retail tools together for better modularity
- **Custom Functions:** All retail tools are implemented as custom async functions
- **YAML Configuration:** Declarative workflow setup for easy customization
