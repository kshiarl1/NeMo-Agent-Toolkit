---

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/retail_agent
```

This will also install the simple calculator example as a dependency since the retail agent uses calculator functions.

### Set Up API Keys

If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run the Workflow

Return to your original terminal, and run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/retail_agent/configs/config.yml --input "Email From: john.doe@email.com
Content: I'm interested in learning about your garden trowels. What options do you have available?"
```

---

## Agent Capabilities

The retail agent can handle three main types of customer requests:

1. **Product Inquiries:** Customers can ask about specific products or request information about the entire catalog.
2. **Order Placement:** Customers can place orders for products with automatic stock validation and price calculation.
3. **Review Submission:** Existing customers can submit reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.

---

## Example Usage

### Product Inquiry

**Input:**
```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/retail_agent/configs/config.yml --input "Email From: david.brown@email.com
Content: Hello, I'm interested in learning about your garden trowels. What do you have available?"
```

**Expected Output:**
The agent will use the `get_product_info` or `get_all_products` tool to retrieve information about garden trowels and respond with product details including description, price, and stock availability.

---

### Review Submission

**Input:**
```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/retail_agent/configs/config.yml --input "Email From: john.doe@email.com
Content: I'd like to write a review for the Premium Garden Trowel I purchased. It's fantastic! I give it 5 stars. The stainless steel is very durable and the grip is comfortable."
```

**Expected Output:**
The agent will:
1. Look up the customer information using `get_customer_info`
2. Verify the product exists using `get_product_info`
3. Submit the review using `write_review`
4. Send a confirmation email using `send_email`

---

### Order Placement

**Input:**
```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/retail_agent/configs/config.yml --input "Email From: sarah.smith@email.com
Content: I would like to order 2 Ergonomic Watering Cans. Can you process this order and let me know the total cost?"
```

**Expected Output:**
The agent will:
1. Look up customer information using `get_customer_info`
2. Check product details and stock using `get_product_info`
3. Calculate the total cost using calculator tools (2 × $45.99 = $91.98)
4. Update customer order information using `update_customer_info`
5. Send order confirmation using `send_email`

---

### Order with Multiple Products

**Input:**
```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/retail_agent/configs/config.yml --input "Email From: emma.wilson@email.com
Content: I want to order 3 Premium Garden Trowels and 2 pairs of Premium Garden Gloves. What will be the total cost?"
```

**Expected Output:**
The agent will calculate: (3 × $29.99) + (2 × $29.99) = $149.95 and provide order details.

   - Input: email (string)
   - Output: Customer object with id, name, past orders, total orders, total spent, and past reviews

2. **get_product_info** - Retrieves single product details
   - Input: product_id or product_name (string)
   - Output: Product object with id, name, description, price, stock, and reviews

3. **get_all_products** - Lists all products for comparison
   - Input: None
   - Output: List of all products with basic information

4. **write_review** - Mock function to add a review
   - Input: customer_email (string), product_name (string), rating (integer 1-5), review_text (string)

## Notes

- **Mock Operations:** The `write_review`, `send_email`, and `update_customer_info` functions are mock operations for demonstration purposes. They do not persist data to the JSON files.
- **Demo Purpose:** This example is designed for demonstration and testing. In a production environment, you would integrate with actual databases and email services.
- **Future Enhancements:** This example serves as a foundation for adding red teaming and defense capabilities to test agent robustness and security.

---

## Architecture

This example uses:
- **ReAct Agent:** Provides iterative reasoning between tool calls to handle complex multi-step customer requests
- **Function Groups:** Organizes related retail tools together for better modularity
- **Custom Functions:** All retail tools are implemented as custom async functions
- **YAML Configuration:** Declarative workflow setup for easy customization
- **JSON Data:** Lightweight file-based "database" simulation
- **Plugin System:** Uses Python entry points for automatic component discovery
